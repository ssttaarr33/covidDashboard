            "text": "Since its emergence, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global health threat. 1 As of April 2020, over 2.8 million cases of Covid-19 have been documented worldwide with nearly 200,000 deaths. 2,3 With ongoing community transmission from asymptomatic individuals across numerous international foci, 4-8 the burden of this disease is expected to continue rising over the coming weeks. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Consequently, there will be an ongoing need for frontline healthcare workers (HCW) in patient-facing roles. Because this work requires close personal exposure to patients with the virus, frontline HCWs are at high risk of infection, which may contribute to further spread. 13,14 Initial regional estimates suggest frontline HCWs may account for 10-20% of all diagnoses, 15-17 which may be an underestimate when compared to other developed and similarly affected nations such as Italy. 18 Based on experience with other viruses spread by respiratory droplets, the consistent use of disposable personal protective equipment (PPE) is critical to reducing nosocomial transmission. 19, 20 Recent guidelines from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) advocate for the use of medical-grade masks and respirators at all times to deliver clinical care. 21 However, global shortages of masks, face shields, and gowns-exacerbated by surging demand and supply chain disruptions-have been documented, leading to efforts to conserve PPE through extended use or reuse and the development of sterilization protocols. [22] [23] [24] Although addressing the needs of frontline HCWs to effectively respond to the Covid-19 pandemic is a high priority, 17 there is a lack of prospective data to inform such efforts. Thus, we conducted a prospective, population-based study using a novel mobile-based application to examine the risk of testing positive for Covid-19 and/or developing symptoms associated with infection among 2,135,190 individuals in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and the United States (U.S.) between March 24 and April 23, 2020.",

Second, our findings are based on self-report. Given the quickened pace of the pandemic, self-reported information was more feasible to collect. In future studies, self-reports with linkage to other sources (e.g. electronic health records) may be possible. Third, our cohort is not a random sampling of the population. Although this limitation is inherent to any study requiring voluntary provision of health information, we acknowledge that data collection through smartphone adoption has comparatively lower penetrance among certain socioeconomic groups, as well as older adults, despite being used by 81% of the U.S. adult population. 37 In future studies, we plan more targeted outreach of populations under-represented in the current cohort, as well as additional data collection instruments (e.g. web or phone surveys) that may be more accessible to certain groups. Finally, our primary outcome is based on report of a positive Covid-19 test. During the time frame of this study, this would generally reflect nasal or throat swabs, which are reasonably specific, but only modestly sensitive. 38 However, any testing misclassification should be non-differential by occupation. Our results may also reflect differences in access to testing among HCWs compared to the general community, as well as true differences in infection rates. In our secondary analyses, we also found that HCWs were at higher risk of a positive test even after adjusting for greater probability of receiving a test. Furthermore, HCWs were at higher risk of developing symptoms that predicted Covid-19, which does not reflect access to testing. Ideally, we would assess the risk of Covid-19 infection within a population which has undergone uniform screening. However, the current shortage of PCR-based testing kits does not make such an approach feasible. Future studies using serologic testing to ascertain Covid-19 infection will require additional assessment of test performance and the ability to distinguish recent or active infection from past exposure.",

This risk is greatest among individuals in direct contact with Covid-19 patients who report inadequate PPE availability, supporting the importance of providing adequate supplies. However, because infection risk remained elevated even with adequate PPE, our results suggest the need to ensure the proper use of PPE as well as adherence to other infection control measures.",

An analysis according to sex demonstrated similar risk estimates among male (aHR 14.0, 95% CI: 12.4 to 15.8) and female (aHR 11.3, 95% CI: 10.5-12.1) frontline HCWs. We considered the possibility that the observed difference in risk in the U.K. vs. the U.S. may be related to differences in the risk profile of individuals eligible for testing. A multivariable-adjusted IPW Cox proportional hazards model weighted by predictors of testing demonstrated consistent associations between being a frontline HCW and reporting a positive Covid-19 test in the U.S. (aHR 1.29, 95% CI: 1.19 to 1.41) and the U.K. (aHR 1.92, 95% CI: 1.89 to 1.94). In a secondary analysis, we used a validated model based on a combination of symptoms to predict likely Covid-19 infection. 26 Compared with the general community, HCWs initially free of symptoms had an aHR of 1.74 (95% CI: 1.71 to 1.77) for predicted Covid-19, which was similar in the U.S. (aHR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.18 to 1.34) and U.K (aHR 1.79, 95% CI: 1.76 to 1.82). PPE usage in frontline HCWs Among frontline HCWs, we assessed the availability of PPE in relation to exposure to Covid-19 patients and subsequent risk for testing positive. Overall, 86% of frontline HCWs reported adequate PPE availability (new and reused), including 85% of those caring for documented Covid-19-positive patients. Compared to those reporting adequate availability, frontline HCWs reporting inadequate PPE had a 23% increased risk of subsequently testing positive for Covid-19 (aHR 1.23, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.46; Table 3). Frontline HCWs with inadequate PPE in direct contact with a documented Covid-19 positive patient had an aHR of 5.94 (95% CI: 4.57 to 7.72) for a positive Covid test compared to those with adequate PPE who were not in contact with suspected or documented Covid-19 patients.
