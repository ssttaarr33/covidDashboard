This was especially true for China, a country with 1.3 billion people. With limited stockpiles of antiviral drugs, the absence of a vaccine in China, and little pre-existing immunity to the new virus in the aged population compared with those in Western countries, 7e9 the situation could have been devastating. Moreover, some Western provinces and many rural areas of the country have insufficient health facilities and therefore lack the optimal capacity to respond to the new virus.",

The nation that experienced severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 will never drop its guard against emerging infectious diseases. Since then, there has been substantial progress in the construction of a national public health system and hospitals for infectious diseases. 10 The web-based direct disease reporting system which allowed the Ministry of Health (MOH) to get information on public health emergencies directly from grassroots-level health professionals may be considered as a demonstration of an enhanced surveillance system. In addition, when the first human case of avian influenza was reported in 2005, 11 the influenza surveillance system was expanded to include 197 sentinel hospitals and 63 public health laboratories in all provinces. These efforts in recent years have laid an important foundation for the country to weather the current pandemic.",

Under the direction of the State Council, the NRPC was led by the MOH, with the involvement of 33 different ministries. Eight task forces were formed to oversee all prevention and response strategies for the emerging pandemic. These types of intersectoral collaboration were also mirrored at provincial and local levels. Importantly, a special scientific advisory committee (SAC) was set up to provide technical support for evidence-based policy-making. In answering the call of the MOH, scientists from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Chinese CDC) succeeded in establishing real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic kits within 72 h of the genetic sequence being provided by the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention.",

In late April, H1N1 was categorized as a notifiable and quarantinable disease. Subsequently, controls and entry screening were tightened at national borders. The first confirmed case (a traveller from North America returning to Sichuan province) was reported on 11 May 2009. 12 All close contacts of that case on the same flight were immediately informed and put under medical observation for 7 days. The same approach was taken for other 'imported' cases, although this meant a huge amount of work at certain cost.

Between 30 April and 23 August 2009, more than 56 million individuals were scanned at border entries, 17,909 febrile patients were identified and 757 (4.2%) were subsequently confirmed. 13 Among the 9938 close contacts under medical observation, 551 (5.5%) were confirmed to have acquired the H1N1 infection. Such large-scale implementation of strong measures was supported by technological advances, including the distribution of PCR diagnostic kits to all public health and port-of-entry laboratory networks in early May. Beijing's experiences of these containment strategies were also shown to detect the H1N1 cases efficiently, with a considerable usage of resources. 14 The absence of large clusters until early June also suggests that the system succeeded in preventing sustained chains of transmission from the initial imported cases and in delaying the spread of the pandemic. The first 'local' cluster of 50 confirmed and 69 suspected cases without any clear links to international travel was reported in Guangdong province on 18 June, 38 days after the detection of the first 'imported' case. 15 A discussion was organized by the SAC on a possible adjustment of the control strategy. Given that the 'local' transmission was still quite limited and the schools in China would soon start the summer break, the SAC suggested that the containment strategy should be continued until July, which would significantly reduce the speed and scale of community outbreak. This suggestion was endorsed by the MOH and then at the level of the NRPC. To support this decision, the Ministry of Education decided to start the summer break at the beginning of July, approximately 10 days ahead of the usual schedule, and asked schools to cancel all unnecessary group activities during the summer holidays. This decision, together with the public health campaign at the community and public transport level, might allow China to experience 2 additional months of low pandemic activity. From May to August, a total number of 3779 cases were reported in China, and 885 were 'imported' cases ( Fig. 1 ). Mathematical modelling estimated that a reduction of 93% of new cases was achieved by the containment strategy during the first 90 days. 16 Thus, by delaying the inevitable acceleration of the pandemic until autumn, containment efforts were considered to win more time for other measures and preparations, such as improving the surveillance system, training health professionals for diagnosis and treatment of pandemic patients (especially in the low-income western provinces), and developing and licensing antiviral medicines and vaccines.",

As the virus continued to spread, the containment strategy became too resourceintensive and costly to maintain. Meanwhile, a large body of clinical data from China and abroad showed that most H1N1 cases were mild. The NRPC thus shifted its strategy from containment to mitigation, with an emphasis on reducing the pandemic impact. On 10 July, the Government removed H1N1 from its list of quarantinable diseases. Accordingly, on 30th September, the MOH decided on a major policy change in disease reporting: case-based surveillance of all H1N1 cases was replaced by sentinel surveillance of patients with influenza-like-illness (ILI), event-based surveillance of clusters of ILI, and case-based surveillance of laboratoryconfirmed hospitalized cases.",

Also, there was a dramatic change with regard to the percentage of pandemic H1N1 strains isolated from ILI cases. Meanwhile, reports of school outbreaks gradually spread from the coastal cities to the rural areas and western provinces after October.

In the containment phase, limited numbers of imported cases were detected.

Antivirals were also provided to high-risk close contacts, including pregnant women, persons with severe chronic medical conditions, children aged <5 years, elderly people aged 65 years, and healthcare workers. During the initial 2 months, 82.3% of confirmed H1N1 mild cases were administered oseltamivir (72.4% within 48 h of the onset of illness). 18 Since July, when the mitigation phase started, China focused on managing and treating patients with severe illness (Table 2) . Antiviral production and distribution were accelerated to prepare for the pandemic's peak. Patients were treated in designated hospitals to make optimal use of healthcare resources. Antivirals were recommended to those with severe or high-risk infections. 20 Other innovative treatments, such as Chinese traditional medicine and antiserum therapy, were also introduced. The use of Chinese traditional medicine treatment was recommended in the Chinese guidelines for the treatment of H1N1. In a prospective multicentre clinical trial leaded by Chen Wang and Bin Cao, the efficacy and safety of a Chinese traditional therapy, Maxing-shiganeYinqiaosan, in the treatment of H1N1 was evaluated in 2009. The results showed that the Chinese herb mixture reduced fever as well as oseltamivir in mild cases of H1N1. 21 In addition, the Chinese Government strengthened the treatment capacity of low-income provinces through additional investments in medical facilities and stockpiles.",

The rapid development and deployment of the H1N1 vaccine represents a major achievement in China's response. However, the initial situation for China was far from satisfactory. Only one Chinese vaccine company, Sinovac in Beijing, China, acquired a licence to produce 'pre-pandemic' vaccine for H5N1 in 2008, 22 Before 1 October 2009, her 60th National Day, China became the first nation to begin mass-vaccinating highpriority groups. 26, 27 The timing was critical since national celebration ceremonies were planned. The vaccination campaign offered vaccines free of charge for all recipients and was voluntary. The campaign was first started among doctors, nurses, border staff and 200,000 performers taking part in the official celebrations. Subsequently, the campaign was extended to the priority population according to the MOH guideline for vaccination against pandemic H1N1. The priority group included healthcare workers, frontline public servants, schoolchildren and people with chronic diseases, particularly in the badly affected regions. When the vaccine became more abundant, the campaign was extended to any interested persons aged 3 years old. 27 On 11 December 2009 and 7 January 2010, the vaccination campaign was extended to pregnant women and children aged 6e35 months. Children aged 6e35 months were eligible for two doses of the vaccine, each with 7.5 mg of haemaglutinin. Vaccination was offered at the routine childhood immunization sites and also at the provisional sites for mass vaccination. All vaccine recipients or their guardians provided written informed consent and completed a brief medical history to identify persons at higher risk or with contraindications. 28 Pandemic vaccine production and inoculation may not only have prevented millions of people from getting H1N1 infection and protected those highrisk vaccinees from severe complications or death, but also contributed to social stability and prevention of public panic to a degree. In Beijing, 72% of schoolchildren, 60% of healthcare workers and other high-risk groups were immunized as of March 2010, and the high vaccine effectiveness of 87% in school-age children 28 showed that mass vaccination formed an immune barrier in the Beijing population and lessened school outbreaks.",

Cross-sectional surveys undertaken by the Chinese CDC showed that farmers had lower vaccination uptake compared with healthcare workers, students, teachers and office staff in urban areas. 31 Barriers to the uptake of the pandemic vaccine included concerns about the vaccine's side-effects and effectiveness in the general population and among healthcare workers, lack of knowledge about the national strategy, and scepticism of the necessity of vaccination, especially when the number of cases decreased during the later stages of the pandemic. 31,32",

China's response shows how a huge challenge can be transformed into an opportunity, and may offer some valuable lessons not only for China but also for the international community. First, the country was able to act quickly and decisively thanks to the strong command and control structure established right from the beginning. It put in place a multisector coordination mechanism, clear chains of command and division of responsibilities to ensure an integrated approach that covered all potentially affected areas while avoiding duplication. To cope with challenges in coordinating between the 33 different ministries and improving intercommunication, information was shared through periodic meetings, videoconferences, regular reports and using web-based information systems. It is recommended that a similar mechanism should be defined in the updated National Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Plan.",

The national influenza surveillance network was expanded and the laboratory testing of influenza and other respiratory viruses was strengthened. Rapid and cross-sectional serological investigations were also performed at different stages of the pandemic. These combined efforts provided a scientific basis for epidemiological evaluation, trend projection and adjustments in control and prevention measures. Third, advances were made in the treatment of cases through the use of traditional Chinese medicine and antiserum therapy. Vulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities and people in rural areas were ensured access to medical relief and social security systems.",

This was made possible through active government participation, multisectoral support and coordination by the scientific research units. To solve the bottleneck problem of lacking availability of WHO reference standards and challenges in shortening each process of vaccine development and approval, a 'Research and Development, Production Coordination and Linkage Mechanism on Pandemic H1N1 Vaccine' was established by the authorities and vaccine manufacturers in early June. An alternative method for viral antigen quantification was developed by the National Institutes for Food and Drug Control prior to the arrival of the WHO reference standards which enabled vaccine approval 1 month earlier, 23 and a fast-track for vaccine approval was opened by the SFDA. Free and voluntary immunization helped to protect those high-risk people, and to reduce social panic and potential disruption to the economy.",

To solve the problem, the MOH decided in late MayeJune to (i) set up a close collaboration between the Chinese vaccine industry and WHO, as well as its reference laboratories involved in pandemic vaccine research and development; (ii) boost the capacity for pandemic H1N1 vaccine research, development, manufacture and quality control by standardizing and applying technical procedures to all the domestic companies; (iii) speed up vaccine preparation through research on the standards by local Chinese institutions, while waiting for standards for key viral antigen quantification from the WHO reference laboratories 23 ; (iv) organize one centralized clinical trial of the products from the 10 vaccine companies by the Chinese CDC; and (v) boost the capacity of the vaccine industry to provide vaccine coverage of at least 5% of China's population by the end of 2009. With all five objectives reached, on 22 July 2009, China launched a multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled trial in seven provinces, recruiting 12,691 people aged 3 years. Through this, one dose of non-adjuvant splitvirion vaccine containing 15 mg haemaglutinin was recommended as the formulation of choice against pandemic (H1N1) 2009 for adolescents and adults. 24,25 Soon after, on 23 August 2009, the State Food and Drug Administration of China (SFDA) approved the pandemic H1N1 vaccine.",
