Stem nodules formed only on submerged stems of flooded plants (mean of 25 per plant), and did not form on aerial parts, although they were capable of growing and fixing N^ after drainage of the stems. Root nodules formed on both non-flooded and flooded plants but were usually decreased in number by flooding (from means of 124 to 51 per plant, respectively). Flooding (and stem-nodulation) resulted in an increase in shoot (and a decrease in root) dry weight, regardless of rhizobial isolate. Stem nodules were attached by a wide collar of aerenchymatous tissue at the base of the nodule. There were large air spaces in the stem where nodules were subtended and these were continuous with nodule aerenchyma/outer corte.x. In addition, aerenchyma and spongy tissue at the base of the nodule connected both flooded and non-flooded root nodules to large intercellular spaces in the root cortex. The stem and root nodules were ovoid in shape, and essentially aeschynomenoid in type, i.e. the central infected tissue was without uninfected, interstitial cells. Root nodules had a similar structure to stem nodules (although stem nodules were generally larger), and flooded root nodules were approximately twice the size of non-flooded nodules. The infected tissue of root and stem nodules consisted of spherical, bacteroid-containing cells containing one or two rod-shaped bacteroids per peribacteroid unit and prominent organelles. Infection threads were observed in root but not in stem nodules.",

Cell layers external to these consisted of larger cells and intercellular spaces, with some spaces being occluded with an electron-dense material that contained a glycoprotein recognized by the monoclonal antibodies MAC236 and MAC265. The amount of glycoprotein occlusions did not appear to differ between nodule types or treatments, although stem nodules contained intracellular glycoprotein vesicles adjacent to cell walls. The exterior of the nodules consisted of an epidermis of thin flattened cells with occasional lenticels. Amyloplasts were common in lower stem and hypocotyl nodules, but fewer in flooded or non-flooded root nodules. Upper stem nodules (i.e. those within 6 cm of the water surface) differed from more profoundly submerged stem nodules by having chloroplasts throughout the cortex. Root nodules did not contain chloroplasts, and undifferentiated plastids were found mainly in lower stem nodules.",

The plant supplies photosynthetically-derived carbon to the bacteroids (the symbiotic, Nj-Bxing form of the rhizobia) and, in return, the bacteroids pass fixed nitrogen (ammonium) to the host plant. In recent years, much attention has been focused on a different form of legume nodulation, that of their stems. Stem nodulation is a relatively rare phenomenon that, until recently, has been confirmed only in some species of the hydrophytic genera Aeschynomene and Sesbania (Arora, 1954; Yatazawa & Yoshida, 1979; Dreyfus & Dommergues, 1981; Eaglesham & Szalay, 1983; Alazard, 1985; Vaughn & Elmore, 1985) , Reports that stem nodules also occur on aquatic Neptunia species are likely to be erroneous (James et al., 1992a) and a misquote of Schaede (1940) . However, the short list of stem nodulating legumes has just been increased to three genera by the discovery of nodules on stems of Discolobium (Loureiro et al., 1994) , a relative of Aeschynomene.",

Nodules formed on the stem above the flooded roots overcome the oxygen constraints afllicting submerged root nodules (Ladha et al., 1992a) , Very high Nj fixation rates are claimed for stem-nodulated legumes such as Sesbania rostrata (Ndoye & Dreyfus, 1988; Hungria, Eaglesham & Hardy, 1992; Kwon & Beevers, 1992; Ladha et al., 1992a, 6; Parsons, Raven & Sprent, 1992) , Aeschynomene spp. (Yatazawa & Yoshida, 1979; Eaglesham & Szalay, 1983; Alazard & Duhoux, 1987; Hungria et al., 1992) and Discolobium pulchellum (Loureiro et al., 1994) , As stem nodules are located so close to the photosynthetic apparatus of the plant, they are ideally placed to receive a constant supply of energy substrates. Moreover, most stem nodules also contain chloroplasts, so they may also supplement their energy supply by their own photosynthetic activity (Eaglesham & Szalay, 1983; de Bruijn, 1989; Hungria et al., 1992; Ladha et al. 1992a; Parsons et al., 1992; Parsons, Sprent & Raven, 1993) , This factor might be taken to an extreme in those Aeschynomene species that contain photosynthetic rhizobia that are shown to have light-enhanced nitrogenase activity (Evans et al., 1990; Lorquin et al., 1993; Loureiro et al., 1993) , Whether nodules are formed on aerial (above water) or submerged stems, depends on the species (Ladha et al., 1992a; Lorquin et al., 1993) . Ladha et al. (1992 a) divided stem-nodulating legumes into three groups: (1) 5, rostrata, A. afraspera and A. nilotica which have stems with visible adventitious root/nodule primordia (Alazard, 1985) , and hence profuse nodulation all over the stem, including aerial portions; (2) Aeschynomene species which also have stems with visible nodule/root primordia but form nodules mainly on the submerged stem; and (3) a variety of plants including other Aeschynomene and Sesbania species, as well as Neptunia, Vicia faba and Arachis hypogeae. Ladha et al. (1992 a) suggested that the group 3 plants could not be considered 'true' stem-nodulating legumes as nodule primordia were invisible, and nodules form only on the submerged stem. Since adventitious roots arise from these submerged stems, they should be considered as anatomically more similar to roots.",

As it is a member of the ' Group 3 ' stem nodulators of Ladha et al. (1992 a) we determine whether A. fluminensis has 'genuine' stem nodules (i.e. that they are connected vascularly to the aerial or submerged stem) according to the criteria of James et al. (1992 a) and Loureiro et al. (1994) , and under what conditions and with which rhizobia they form. We also investigate root nodulation in this species and determine whether root and stem nodules can grow and fix Nj under submerged conditions as has been recently demonstrated with Sesbania rostrata (Ladha et al., 19926) , Neptunia plena (James et al., 1992a; James, Minchin & Sprent, 19926) , Discolobium (Loureiro et al., 1994) and Trifolium repens (Pugh et al., 1995) ,",

There are no chloroplasts except some degenerate ones in the mid-cortex (large arrow) (bar, 10/<ni). *V, , Figure 3 . {a) TS of a lower stem nodule after immunogold labelling (plus silver enhancement) with the monoclonal antibody MAC236. MAC236 and MAC265 recognize an intercellular glycoprotein involved in the regulation of oxygen diffusion in legume root nodules (VandenBosch et al., 1989; James et al., 1991) , and the MAC236 antigen can be seen in intercellular spaces in this section (arrows). Note that the glycoprotein is confined to the mid cortex (MC), and is not apparent in the inner cortex (DZ and BL). There are numerous amyloplasts (a) in the mid and inner cortex (bar, 10/<m).

Close to the space, and adjacent to cell walls are intracellular vesicles (arrows) that are immunogold labelled with MAC265 (Fig. Ttd) . The intercellular space is much more 4 mm for stem nodules) and lighter (0-5-1 mg d.wt per root nodule compared with 2-4 mg d.wt per stem nodule), regardless of flooding (Table 1) . However, tbey were similar in morphology and structure to stem nodules (Figs la, 4a) . Nodules were often observed attached to tbe roots at lateral root junctions but not always (F^ig. 4a). Tbey were connected to tbe root by a wide base of spongy cells, and large air spaces were observed in tbe root cortex adjacent to the nodule bases (Fig. 4a, b) . These spaces were presumably a continuation of tbe air patbways observed in tbe stems (Fig. 1 d) and were present in botb flooded and non-flooded roots. Some lenticellular tissue was also present on flooded roots (Fig. lfl) .",

This pattern of distribution was confirmed using immunogold labelling under TF;M (Fig. Zb,c) . However, TFM also showed that adjacent to sparsely-labelled spaces in the mid-cortex of both stem and root nodules were numerous intracellular vesicles that contained the glycoprotein (Fig. 2c, d) ; the vesicles usually being more intensely labelled by MAC265 than the intercellular spaces in this region.

The decline in number and activity of root nodules, along with a parallel increase in stem nodulation, has been attributed to a lack of oxygen available to tbe roots under flooded conditions. This causes the production of aerial stem nodules which do not normally have such oxygen constraints (Dreyfus & Dommergues, 1981; Eaglesham & Szalay, 1983; Alazard & Duhoux, 1987; Ndoye & Dreyfus, 1988) . However, the decline in root nodules has also been attributed to tbe preferential production of stem nodules (and tbe actual suppression of root nodulation), regardless of flooding. Stem nodules might be more eflicient at sparsely labelled than that in Fig. 36 where MAC236 was used (bar, 1 //m).

The reluctance of A. fluminensis, A. elaphroxylon (Vaughn & Elmore, 1985) , and other Group 3 species (Ladha et al., 1992a) , to form aerial stem nodules might be a result of the unexposed adventitious root primordia on the stems of these plants. By not being exposed they are inaccessible to invading rhizobia, except when inundated (Alazard & Duhoux, 1987) . By contrast, other stemnodulating legumes such as S. rostrata and A. afraspera possess protruding root primordia that allow for aerial rhizobial infection without prior flooding of stems (Tsien, Dreyfus & Schmidt, 1983 ; Alazard & Duhoux, 1988) .",

However, recent results by Parsons et al. (1992) with 5. rostrata showed little difference between root and stem nodules when a 'flow-through' ARA was used. Flow-through systems allow a more accurate estimate of nitrogenase activity from ARA (Witty & Minchin, 1988) as, unlike the closed assay system used in the present study, they do not mask the acetylene-induced decline in nitrogenase activity that occurs in many symbioses. Therefore, at this stage we can say only that A. fluminensis stem and root nodules under flooded and non-flooded conditions exhibited significant nitrogenase activity. We cannot compare them with results from other studies of legumes with stem nodules and/or submerged nodules. On the other hand, the present study has shown that flooding and stem-nodulation of A. fluminensis resulted in enhanced shoot growth compared with non-flooded, purely root-nodulated plants, and this was generally achieved with fewer nodules. It is possible, therefore, that the fewer, larger nodules on stems and roots of flooded plants are more efficient at Nj-fixation than are the numerous small root nodules on non-flooded plants.",

However, A. fluminensis root nodules differ from the usual aeschynomenoid-type in having occasional infection threads; hence it is likely that infection threads are involved in entry of rhizobia into the host cells of A. fluminensis rather than via host cell wall dissolution as suggested for other Aeschynomene species (Vaughn & Elmore, 1985; Stegink & Vaughn, 1988; Alazard & Duhoux, 1990) . This, plus the recent report of infection threads in Discolohium nodules by Loureiro et al.

There are generally 1-3 bacteroids per PBU (arrows) and note the infection thread (large arrow) in one of the cells (bar, hydroxybutyrate (PHB), a carbon storage compound that accumulates in bacteroids under decreased pOj (Stem et al., 1986) , Flooded root nodules also did not appear to have more starch or PHB than did nonflooded root nodules, suggesting that flooded stem and root nodules were possibly no more oxygenlimited than were their terrestrial counterparts. The large starch deposits seen in lower stem nodules might have resulted from the closeness of the nodules to the supply of photosynthate from the stem and hence could indicate a surplus of carbohydrate.",

Those chloroplasts that were in the distribution zone cells appeared to be little more than undifferentiated plastids, similar to those seen in lower stem nodules.

It is therefore likely that the oxygen needs of submerged A. fluminensis nodules are in large part supplied by diffusion down a stem pathway, and the occurrence of large air spaces in the stem and roots where nodules subtend them with spongy aerating tissue provides structural evidence for this. This was also suggested for nodules of Neptunia and Discolobium (James et al., 1992a, 6; Loureiro et al., 1994) , where there was also extensive aerenchyma from the stem down to the nodules. However, unlike Neptunia and Discolobium, aerenchyma did not appear to be present on or within A. fiuminensis stems (although it was visible at the base of tap roots. Fig. 1 a) , and most nodules had only a few lenticels, suggesting that the internal stem-root aeration pathway to the submerged stem nodules is most important. In addition, the lack of external aerenchyma would decrease any effects of increased nodule aeration via water currents such as those shown with Neptunia (James et al., 19926) , Although these three hydrophytic species are native to the Pantanal Matogrossense, they might differ slightly in habitat as A. fluminensis might be more adapted to living in stagnant or still water rather than in the gently-flowing backwaters beside which Neptunia and Discolobium grow (Loureiro et al., 1994) .",

(1991) , In conventional terrestrial legume nodules such as those on soybean {Glycine max) a DB is necessary to protect nitrogenase from oxygen concentrations above microaerobic (Witty et al., 1986; Gallon, 1992) . Any fluctuations in the demand for oxygen by the bacteroids are offset by adjustments in the resistance of the cortical oxygen diffusion barrier and by rapid bacteroid respiration (Witty et al., 1986) , In A. fiuminensis there were no apparent differences in diffusion barrier structure, e,g. the extent of glycoprotein occlusions (James et al., 1991) and intracellular vesicles (Iannetta et al., 1995) between stem and root nodules, or between submerged and non-flooded root nodules. This suggests that oxygen diffusion resistance varied little between nodule types, regardless of flooding, although this remains to be tested. These structural observations, plus the enhanced shoot growth with flooding, suggest that oxygen supply to submerged stem and root nodules was adequate and did not adversely affect Nj fixation.",

Stem nodules have formed all over the flooded stem (white arrows) to within 1 cm of the surface of the water (9 cm above the hypocotyl; not shown). Root nodules are also visible (black arrows) and there is aerenchyma (a) where the tap root joins the hypocotyl (bar, 1 cm), (b) Longitudinal section (LS) of a piece of stem with an upper stem nodule. The nodule (N) is attached to the stem (S) by a short stalk of spongy cells (asterisk). Note the vascular bundles in the nodule cortex (arrows) and the lenticel (large arrow) (bar 250//m). (c) Transverse section (TS) of stem/nodule junction",
