Health care workers (HCW) are at increased risk for COVID-19 because upper GI endoscopy is a high-risk aerosol-generating procedure, 2 and oral-fecal transmission might be a potential route for COVID-19. 3 Recommendations have been changing rapidly and need to be updated, mainly because we are facing a scenario of sustained community transmission of COVID-19 worldwide. 4 To conduct an overview of the recommendations for endoscopic procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, we assessed electronic sites of international/national societies of gastroenterology/gastrointestinal endoscopy to review the current recommendations up to March 27, 2020. Overall, 93 international/national societies were identified, and 21 of them have elaborated specific recommendations for endoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic (supplementary material available upon request). A total of 95% recommended temporarily postponing elective/nonurgent procedures; 86% to stratify patients for risk of COVID-19 before the examination (questionnaire of symptoms and/or patient's body temperature); 38% to reduce the number of people who accompany patients; 33% to stimulate self-surveillance of signs/symptoms by HCW, and 19% to contact patients 14 days after the examination to check symptoms (supplementary material available upon request).",
