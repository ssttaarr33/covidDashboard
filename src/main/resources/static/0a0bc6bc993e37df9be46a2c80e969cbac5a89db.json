An outbreak of feline infectious peritonitis was investigated in a closed colony of European wildcats (Fells silvestris) at a zoological garden. Over a six-year period, a putative fading kitten syndrome occurred in six of 11 litters born and severe lesions of infectious peritonitis occurred in five of the eight wildcats retained in the colony during this period. Lesions were more acute in the early stages of the outbreak and included perivascular pyogranulomatons inflammation with exudative serositis. Lesions occurred only in males. Vascular lesions were common in the liver of all affected wildcats, serositis occurred in the abdominal and thoracic cavities in most cases and meningeal lesions were present in two cases. Immunohistochemistry with specific antisera detected viral antigen within macrophages in all lesions. This outbreak demonstrates that the lesions of feline infectious peritonitis can become modified over time and that the virus can persist in a closed colony, possibly via carrier wildcats.",

Studies on the pathogenesis of FIPV in both domestic and exotic cats have demonstrated that an acute, fulminant disease (so-called \"wet\" or \"effusive\" FIP) can occur on challenge of seropositive cats as compared with a milder response (so-called \"dry\" or \"non-effusive\" FIP) in seronegative cats (for a review see Pedersen, 1983) . It is believed that the presence of pre-existing antibody leads to either immune complex deposition (Jacobese-Geels, Daha and Horzinek, 1982) or antibodydependent enhancement of macrophage infection upon challenge by FIPV (Olsen, Corapi, Ngichabe, Baines and Scott, 1992) . Therefore, naturally and experimentally ini~cted domestic cats develop lesions with a marked variation in intensity, depending on the cat's antibody status.",

Early in the outbreak, European wildcats developed an acute, effusive \"wet\" form of infectious peritonitis, whereas in the later years of the outbreak, chronic \"dry\" lesions of peritonitis produced a debilitating form of the disease with nervous signs present in some animals due to meningeal vasculitis. This study was the first to use immunohistochemistry to locate FIPV antigen in exotic cats and the distribution of antigen detected was similar to that recorded in FIPV infection of domestic cats (Weiss and Scott, 1981 a,b) . Therelbre the similarity of clinical and pathological features in these exotic cats affected with infectious peritonitis to those seen in domestic cats was probably due to the viral infection of macrophages and consequent development of lesions occurring in a similar manner. Also, the alteration in the type of lesion over the 10-year outbreak indicated that the immune status of the individuals varied with their age, as animals dying of the \"wet\" form of FIP early in the outbreak were 3 and 7 years old and those dying later in the outbreak of\"dry\" FIP were 9 or l0 years old.

It is possible that a virus-positive carrier may have introduced the virus and been the mechanism by which the virus persisted in the colony over a period of 10 years. Coronaviruses related to FIPV can be present in lkline faeces (Pedersen, Boyle, Floyd, Fudge and Baker, 1981) period of the \"dry\" FIP may be several months, affected animals may harbour and shed virus for some time before developing clinical signs and dying. Interestingly, all the animals that died of confirmed FIP were male, despite approximately equal (10 vs 12) numbers of male and female offspring in the colony. Apparent increased susceptibility of males has also been noted in domestic cats (Potkay, Bacher and Pitts, 1974; Robinson, Holzworth and Gilmore, 1971) , although other studies have shown no particular sex predisposition (Pedersen, 1976) . In the outbreak in a domestic cat colony reported by Potkay and colleagues a seasonal incidence of deaths due to FIP was noticed, with most occurring during the winter months. Similarly, in this colony four of the five deaths occurred between October and March. The reason for this is unclear although \"stress\" factors of temperature variation have been suggested. Poor neonatal survival of kittens was also a problem in this colony, seven of 22 kittens having died within one month of birth. Although none of these deaths were closely investigated this type of syndrome has been associated with FIPV infection (McKiernan, Evermann, Hargis, Miller and Ott, 1981) .",

In this study lesions due to hepatocyte infection were the earliest changes detectable in the liver, with syncytium formation and necrosis. These lesions were analogous to those caused by another coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus (Blackmore, Guillon and Schwanzer, 1981) . Macrophages in the liver of the wildcats, including Kupffer cells, were also infected with the virus. As virus is rarely found free in the blood a cell-borne transmission to the hepatocyte is likely, probably via the Kupffer cells. The frequency of infection ofnon-macrophage cells in other organs is not known but was not common in this study.",
