In the smartphone era a population can be immune to epidemics even if not a single one of its members is immune to the disease-a notion we propose to call \"digital herd immunity\", which is similarly an emergent characteristic of the population. This immunity arises because contact-tracing protocols based on smartphone capabilities can lead to highly efficient quarantining of infected population members and thus the extinguishing of nascent epidemics. When the disease characteristics are favorable and smartphone usage is high enough, the population is in this immune phase. As usage decreases there is a novel \"contact tracing\" phase transition to an epidemic phase. We present and study a simple branching-process model for COVID-19 and show that digital immunity is possible regardless of the proportion of non-symptomatic transmission. We believe this is a promising strategy for dealing with COVID-19 in many countries such as India, whose challenges of scale motivated us to undertake this study in the first place and whose case we discuss briefly.",

This difficulty is partly due to the novel pathogen involved and partly due to some unusual characteristics of COVID-19 [1] , which pose unique obstacles to developing a systematic public health response. Specifically, the infection appears to be transmitted through a large number of asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases and the fraction of such transmission is large enough to lead to an epidemic on its own, even if all symptomatic cases were immediately isolated [1, 2] . This leaves two approaches to controlling an exponential growth in the number of infected people. The first is continuous monitoring of entire populations via regular testing, which can identify new infections already during their latent phase and thus end non-symptomatic transmission. The second is the established method of \"contact tracing\" [3] , in which people who have been exposed to newly identified infected people are isolated before they have a chance to infect others. In principle, either approach is capable of ending the epidemic.",

Traditional contact tracing, done by teams of health officials relying on interviews with newly identified cases, is also not up to the task today, as it fails if non-symptomatic transmission is too frequent [3, 4] . Fortunately, we live in the smartphone era, and it has been noted that using these devices to record contacts can make the task of tracing them entirely solvable by automating it. This idea has been spelled out in a series of papers [5, 6] and is the basis for a rapidly expanding set of contact-tracing apps and the recent announcement by the Apple-Google duopoly of their intention to build the technology into their operating systems [7] . We note that the possibility of using mobile networks to study disease dynamics has been explored in the past [8] [9] [10] .",

First, we present a simple model of the early stages of the spread of COVID-19, which allows us to obtain estimates, as a function of a varying amount of non-symptomatic transmission, of the fraction of the population that needs to participate in a digital contact sharing network in order to prevent new epidemics. Our interest in this question was seeded by the very practical question of whether a country like India can use this technology to achieve epidemic control today. Indeed, India is now launched on this enterprise [11] . While somewhat more complex modeling with various differences from our own became available while we were working on this problem [5, 12] , we feel that our approach has the virtue of making the existence and values of the estimated compliance thresholds transparent. Our estimates for the fraction of the population that needs to own a contact-tracing app to avert a COVID-19 epidemic range from 75% \u2212 95%, depending on the fraction of asymptomatic transmission, \u03b8 = 20% \u2212 50%, that takes place. Busy epidemiologists and health officials will find this part of interest.",

            "text": "Our second contribution is to frame the overall discussion in a language more familiar to physicists and students of complex phenomena more generally-that of phases, phase transitions and emergent properties. The bottom line here is the idea that the immunity of a population to epidemic growth is an emergent, or collective, property of the population. For traditional vaccination or epidemic-induced \"herd immunity\", this feature gets conflated with the fact that individuals can be immune to the disease at issue. But mass digital contact tracing now makes it possible for the population to be immune to epidemic growth even as no individual has immunity to the underlying disease. We propose to refer to this as the existence of a \"digital herd immunity\". This fits well into the general idea of an emergent property, which does not exist at the level of the microscopic constituents but exists for the collective [13, 14] . We would be remiss if we did not note that epidemiologists have previously referred to this state of affairs as \"herd protection\" and \"sustained epidemic control\" [5] . Our intention with the proposed terminology is both to frame a public health goal by including the word digital and to emphasize the emergent nature of a herd immunity.",

We then introduce a simple branching-process model for the spread of this disease, that incorporates the key features necessary to assess the efficacy of a digital, app-based approach, namely asymptomatic transmission, pre-symptomatic transmission and recursive contact tracing. We find in general that there is a critical fraction 0 \u2264 \u03c6 c < 1 of app ownership, such that takeup of contact-tracing apps by a fraction \u03c6 > \u03c6 c of the population is sufficient to prevent epidemic spread. We provide an analytical, \"self-consistent mean-field\" estimate for this threshold, which is verified against detailed numerical simulations.

Next, one finds the people they came into close contact with during their infectious period. Finally, one treats or isolates these people before they can go on to infect others. Manual contact tracing becomes difficult for infections that have a period before the onset of symptoms when an exposed person is contagious (the \u2126 period). Further delay in finding the symptomatic person and their contacts could lead to tertiary infections, making it difficult to control an outbreak. For COVID-19, the incubation period is thought to be around 5-6 days, while the \u2126 period is estimated to be 1-3 days [2] . The time before becoming contagious, or the latent period L, is around 4 days. Stochasticity of these times aside, it is reasonable to expect that if \u2126 < L on average, and if the exposed contacts of an individual can be traced before they become infectious, then an epidemic could be prevented. However, the delays typical for manual contact tracing, even just one or two days, can render contact tracing completely ineffective for COVID-19, given the typical L and \u2126 periods; this conclusion is supported by detailed numerical simulations [5, 12] . This is where digital contact tracing comes in. A smartphone application could enable instant isolation of an infected person and their network of contacts. This halts the transmission chain, because infected contacts cannot infect others during their latent period. The question immediately arises of how widespread such tracing needs to be in order to prevent an epidemic, and this question is the focus of our paper. Below we present a simple model that captures the essential features of disease spread necessary to tackle this problem.",

By contrast, app-based approaches allow for \"recursive\" contact tracing, whereby contacts of contacts can be traced to an arbitrary recursive depth, at no additional cost. The effectiveness of recursive contact tracing has been studied in previous work; mathematically rigorous results exist for purely symptomatic transmission [15, 16] and detailed numerical simulations have been performed that take non-symptomatic transmission into account [17] . Some recent works have provided quantitative estimates for the effectiveness of contact-tracing, both non-recursive and recursive, in the specific context of COVID-19 [5, 6, 12] . Our results should be viewed as complementary to these studies. One comparative advantage of the model that we propose is its simplicity; in particular, it provides a natural starting point for understanding the universal properties of the contact-tracing phase transition.",

The arrows show the alerts sent to everyone connected to the CS individual by the contact network. c) Once the alert is sent out, everybody in the contact-networkconnected component of the CS individual can be quarantined immediately (thick circles) without giving rise to further disease spread, since they are in the latent (non-contagious) periods of their infections.

In an an uncontrolled setting, all types of infectious cases are assumed to proliferate with R 0 = 3, which is a reasonable estimate [18] for COVID-19 1 . Suppose that the outbreak starts from a single infected individual at time t = 0. In our discrete time (generational) model, this person infects R 0 other people at time t = 1, and each new infection is allotted one of the categories {CA, CS, N A, N S} randomly, with probabilities that are determined by the values of \u03b8 and \u03c6. Individuals infected at the beginning of each generation are assumed not to infect anyone else after that generation has elapsed. Whenever a symptomatic person on the contact network (CS) is encountered during this branching process, the contact network is triggered, and all people connected by the network through past and present infections are placed in quarantine. As discussed earlier, since pre-symptomatic infections are common for COVID-19, our model includes the possibility that a CS person infects R S people by the time they trigger the contact network. As a consequence, non-CS people in the same generation also infect the next generation before the activation of the contact network (see Fig. 1c ). A few time-steps of the model are illustrated explicitly in Fig. 1 , together with the implementation of recursive contact tracing via removing connected components of the contact graph. Different combinations of the parameters \u03b8, \u03c6 and R S lead to an effective reproduction number R distinct from the bare reproduction number R 0 , and we expect epidemic growth to be suppressed whenever R < 1.",

Our numerics are consistent with the hypothesis that for any given fraction of asymptomatic transmission 0 \u2264 \u03b8 < 1, and any presymptomatic reproduction number 0 \u2264 R S \u2264 R 0 , there is a critical point \u03c6 c (\u03b8), corresponding to the onset of \"digital herd immunity\": epidemic control occurs for a fraction of app owners \u03c6 c (\u03b8) < \u03c6 \u2264 1. For realistic COVID-19 parameter values, R 0 = 3, R S = 1 and \u03b8 = 0.2 \u2212 0.5 [5, 18] , we find that \u03c6 c (\u03b8) = 75% \u2212 95%, illustrating that when both presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission are taken into account, the rate of app coverage necessary to prevent an epidemic can be rather high. Some practical implications of this point are raised in the final discussion. 1 There are also some higher estimates in the literature, e.g. based on the early epidemic dynamics in Wuhan [19] .

At first sight, India's overall smartphone coverage of around 40% [23] suggests that it might be difficult to attain \"digital herd immunity\" using solely app-based contact tracing [11] . However, smartphone-based measures could be combined with other tracing efforts to compensate for the limited availability of smartphones. Specifically, more traditional interview methods can still be used to reconstruct the location history of a newly diagnosed person. Systematic, random testing might also help in this regard [24] . As almost 90% [23] of Indians use some sort of wireless phone, alerts from people on the app-based network as well as interview-based alerts could be broadcast via SMS and combined with cell tower triangulation for spatial resolution in addition to the temporal resolution that would already be available. Major metropolitan areas, which include a number of COVID-19 hot-spots [25] , would be particularly well-suited to such a dual approach, since they exhibit both higher smartphone coverage and a higher density of cell-phone towers, allowing for more accurate triangulation [26] . Finally, it seems entirely possible to boost smartphone ownership for this purpose by the use of donated used phones and subsidized data provided to run the contact tracing app.",

From a practical standpoint, one worthwhile extension of our model would be to allow for a degree of stochasticity in the basic reproduction number R 0 , for example, by simulating the branching-process model on small-world networks with varying degree per node, which are known to better reflect realistic human contact networks [27, 28] than networks with fixed degree. Indeed, network structure has previously been shown to influence the effectiveness of contact tracing [4, [29] [30] [31] . Meanwhile, an important open problem from the perspective of statistical physics is pinning down the universality class of the contact-tracing transition. Our study of the critical point along the line \u03b8 = 0 indicates that techniques from percolation theory are likely to be useful; on the other hand, the non-local character of recursive contact tracing distinguishes it from the percolation transitions that have arisen in related applications [20, 21, 32, 33] , and suggests that the critical exponents at the transition point differ from those of standard site percolation, even on the Bethe lattice. We leave a detailed exploration of these fascinating questions to subsequent studies.",

Let p N and p C denote the probabilities that an infinite infected cluster is connected to a node of type N and C respectively. We also write f C and f N for the fraction of the population respectively on and off the contact network, which, in the notation of the main text, readWe start by considering the case when R 0 = 2, which means that each infected individual goes on to infect two other people. The possible R 0 = 2 infections generated by an infected individual of typeFor each of these cases, we can write the contribution to the probability p N that the cluster starting from N extends to infinity in terms of p N , p C , f C , and f N aswhere the first term on the RHS is the contribution from the process N \u2192 {C, C}, the second from N \u2192 {N, N }, and the third from N \u2192 {N, C} and N \u2192 {C, N }. To understand Eq. (A2), consider the first term, which corresponds to the process N \u2192 {C, C}. It can be obtained in the following way: given an N infection, the probability of the process N \u2192 {C, C}, assuming independent and uniform distribution of individuals on the network, is given by f 2 C , and the probability that at least one subbranch gives rise to an infinite cluster is then given by 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p C ) 2 , since (1 \u2212 p C ) 2 is the probability that neither C generates an infinite cluster. The other terms in Eq. (A2) can be obtained similarly. Likewise, the possible R 0 = 2 infections starting from C are C \u2192 {N, N }, C \u2192 {N, C} and C \u2192 {C, N }. Note that C \u2192 C transmission is suppressed due to contact tracing. Therefore, the probability that a cluster from C extends to infinity is given by",
