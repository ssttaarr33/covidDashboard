Leach, PhD a,b Upper respiratory tract infections (including otitis media) are the most common illnesses affecting children. 1 The term ''otitis media'' (OM) covers a wide spectrum of disease, and is used to describe illnesses with predominantly middle ear symptoms (including acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, and chronic suppurative otitis media). Children can expect to experience around 6 to 8 upper respiratory infections (URTIs) each year. 2 Nearly all children will experience at least one episode of OM during childhood. On average, they experience around one episode of acute otitis media (AOM) per year in the first 3 years of life. 3 The initial cause of respiratory mucosal infections (including OM) is most commonly a viral infection but can be bacterial ( Table 1) . 4 Of importance is that many infections involve both viruses and bacteria. 5 Most commonly, an initial viral infection is complicated by a secondary bacterial infection. In developed countries, both viral and bacterial infections are likely to be self-limited.

Furthermore, discharging ears as described in Indigenous children (''the running ear are the heritage of the poor'') 62 were common in disadvantaged children living in developed countries in the pre-antibiotic era. 63 For these reasons, the authors believe the most important underlying causes of severe ear infections are likely to be environmental. Indigenous populations at high risk of severe OM also have high rates of rhinosinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, invasive pneumococcal disease, and chronic suppurative lung disease (including bronchiectasis). [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] It is likely that the same risk factors contribute to the excessive frequency of all of these conditions. Early exposure to otitis media pathogens has been demonstrated in Australian Aboriginal infants, and this is the most important determinant of subsequent OM (Fig. 1) . [72] [73] [74] Of importance is that in this high-risk population, children usually have multiple pathogens (and often multiple types of each pathogen) and their total bacterial load is high. International comparisons show that a similar early onset of carriage of the pneumococcus is seen in other populations with high rates of invasive pneumococcal disease (Fig. 2) . 75 Although genetic factors are known to contribute to the risk of OM, their importance in high-risk populations has not been determined.

Insertion of tympanostomy tubes is most appropriate in children for whom the primary concern is the conductive hearing loss and communication difficulties. Children with the most severe conductive hearing loss are most likely to benefit.

[86] [87] [88] A small proportion of children with AOM will experience recurrent AOM (3 episodes in 6 months or 4 episodes within 12 months). 46 There is evidence on the treatment effects of prophylactic antibiotics, adenoidectomy, and tympanostomy tube insertion. 24, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] Antibiotics are proven to be effective but the beneficial effects are modest. The rates of AOM also reduce spontaneously without treatment so that absolute benefits are less impressive than anticipated. Two of the RCTs assessing prophylactic antibiotics have been conducted in Indigenous children. 39, 40 These studies demonstrate that prophylactic antibiotics will prevent perforation of the tympanic membrane. The size of the benefit is similar to prevention of any AOM. Insertion of tympanostomy tubes also seems to reduce rates of AOM, and the effect is similar to antibiotics. Either of these options could be considered in those children from low-risk populations with very frequent infections (especially if occurring before the peak of respiratory illness in winter). However, children with tympanostomy tubes may develop a discharging ear, so this is not a good option in children at increased risk of suppurative infections (including those with immunodeficiency or persistent bacterial rhinosinusitis). For Indigenous children in high-risk populations, prophylactic antibiotics or prompt antibiotic treatment of infections are probably the more appropriate treatment options. Adenoidectomy does not seem to be an effective treatment. [27] [28] [29] Because Indigenous children in high-risk populations are known to have high rates of pneumococcal diseases, there was hope that introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine would have a greater impact on OM in these populations. One RCT in Navajo and Apache children assessed the impact on OM and could not demonstrate substantially improved outcomes. 43 Of note, comparison of longitudinal cohorts before and after the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine found a reduction in OM visits for American Indian children but not for Alaskan Native children. 83 In Australia, comparison of longitudinal cohorts of Aboriginal infants before and after the introduction of the vaccine did not document substantial reductions in severe OM. 43, 89 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 336, "end": 340, "text": "[86]", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 341, "end": 345, "text": "[87]", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 346, "end": 350, "text": "[88]", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 478, "end": 480, "text": "46", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 601, "end": 604, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 605, "end": 609, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 610, "end": 614, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 615, "end": 619, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 620, "end": 624, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 625, "end": 629, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 928, "end": 931, "text": "39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 932, "end": 934, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1875, "end": 1879, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1880, "end": 1884, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1885, "end": 1889, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2248, "end": 2250, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2464, "end": 2466, "text": "83", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 2641, "end": 2644, "text": "43,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2645, "end": 2647, "text": "89", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "OPTIONS FOR INTERVENTIONS: ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA"}, {"text": "A small proportion of children with AOM with perforation go on to develop CSOM. In developed countries, CSOM most commonly occurs as a complication of tympanostomy tube placement.

[31] [32] [33] [34] 79 Interpretation of a large number of small studies is challenging, but topical antibiotics are proven to be effective and the beneficial effects vary from large to modest. Most studies have not documented a long-term effect. Topical antibiotics also seem to be more effective than antiseptics and systemic antibiotics. 31 The role of topical antibiotics plus systematic antibiotics is unclear. 90 Cleaning the middle ear discharge has not been proven to be effective in RCTs but is generally regarded as necessary before insertion of topical antibiotics (at least in children with profuse discharge). Although not seen in RCTs, there is also a very small risk of ototoxicity associated with most topical antibiotics (except topical quinolones) and topical antiseptics. 27 For children who fail to respond to prolonged courses of topical antibiotics, 2 small studies (85 participants) have documented high cure rates and large beneficial effects associated with 2 to 3 weeks of intravenous antipseudomonal antibiotics (such as ceftazidime). 91, 92 Given the available evidence from RCTs on CSOM, most well-informed individuals would choose topical antibiotic treatment. However, even though this is an effective treatment, prolonged or repeated courses of treatment are often required. If this is the case, topical quinolones will provide a slight benefit in terms of risk of ototoxicity. Even in high-risk Indigenous populations there is a considerable difference in the likely response to treatment. Two RCTs comparing ciprofloxacin drops with framycetingramycidin-dexamethasone drops in Australian Aboriginal children with CSOM have been conducted. One trial found most children could be effectively treated within 9 days, whereas the other reported most children with persistent CSOM despite 6 weeks of treatment. 41, 42 Although not the subject of RCTs, the outcomes of tympanoplasty in Indigenous children and adults have been described. These studies usually report effective surgical repair of the tympanic membrane in around 50% to 70% and a modest improvement in hearing. 57, 93, 94 These results are not as good as those seen in other populations, where effective repair is usually achieved in 80% to 90%.
