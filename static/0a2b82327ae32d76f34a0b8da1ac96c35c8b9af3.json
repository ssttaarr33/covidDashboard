The 2019-nCoV belongs to Betacoronavirus genus lineage B, and is phylogenetically closely related to bat SARS-like coronaviruses [2] . However, the spike, ORF8, and ORF3b proteins differ significantly from other known SARS-like coronaviruses, which may confer differences in pathogenicity and transmissibility from SARS-CoV [4] . Similar to SARS-CoV, the 2019-nCoV can be efficiently transmitted between humans. Cases of familial clustering have been reported [2] .",

Cases of 2019-nCoV infection among healthcare workers have been found, with at least 1 reported death [10] . Second, the use of saliva will allow specimen collection outside the hospitals where airborne-infection isolation rooms are not available, such as in outpatient clinics or in the community. In the setting where a large number of individuals require screening, saliva would represent a practical noninvasive specimen type. Third, since healthcare workers are not required to collect saliva specimens, the use of saliva specimens will eliminate the waiting time for specimen collection, and hence the results would be available much sooner.

            "text": "Among patients with serial saliva specimens available, there was a general decline in viral load for most patients, but 1 patient had viral shedding in the saliva for at least 11 days after hospitalization. The use of saliva is preferred over nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimens for serial viral load monitoring because this would reduce the discomfort to the patient and reduce the health hazards to healthcare workers during repeated sampling. Our experience with SARS in 2003 showed that viral load often peaked at day 10 after symptom onset. Thus, early detection and isolation of cases was strategic for infection control and provides the window of opportunity for antiviral therapy to decrease the peak viral load. The positive viral culture indicates that saliva contains live viruses that may allow transmission. Respiratory viruses are considered to be transmitted from person to person through direct or indirect contact, or via coarse or fine droplets. Saliva can be emitted through cough, and respiratory droplets containing influenza virus can be found even during normal breathing [11] . Therefore, 2019-nCoV may be transmitted via saliva directly or indirectly even among patients without coughing or other respiratory symptoms. Our findings reinforce the use of surgical masks as a control measure. SARS-CoV has been shown to infect epithelial cells in salivary gland ducts in rhesus macaques [12] . The presence of 2019-nCoV in patients' saliva suggests the possibility of salivary gland infection. However, it should be noted that saliva specimens not only contain saliva secreted from major or minor salivary glands but also contain secretions coming down from the nasopharynx or coming up from the lung via the action of cilia lining the airway. Further studies are required to delineate the sources of 2019-nCoV in saliva.",
