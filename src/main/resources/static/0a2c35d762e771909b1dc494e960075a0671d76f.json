The addition of a second anti-MRSA agent is controversial [7] , partly because some combinations of commonly used antibiotics for MRSA, such as linezolid with vancomycin, have shown antagonistic effects in animal models of invasive MRSA infection [8] and in experimental in vitro assays [9] . Studies in animals [10] [11] [12] [13] and observational data M A J O R A R T I C L E in humans [14, 15] show that S. aureus toxins likely are driving systemic inflammation, immune suppression, and lung necrosis. Therapies targeted at specific S. aureus toxins are currently being evaluated in randomized trials but are not yet clinically available. Staphylococcus aureus antivirulence effects have been reported in vitro for clindamycin, reducing staphylococcal protein A expression 3.5-fold [16] , Panton-Valentine leukocidin expression 2.5-fold [17] , and alpha hemolysin expression 2.4-to 20-fold [18] in CA-MRSA and other clinical S. aureus strains. Beta-lactam antibiotics were associated with increased S. aureus toxin expression in vitro [18, 19] , and vancomycin had negligible effect.",

Anti-MRSA antibiotics given within 24 hours of PICU admission were associated with hospital outcomes. Children who received early vancomycin as their sole anti-MRSA agent had a 5.5 times higher risk of mortality than children who received early vancomycin plus the early addition of another anti-MRSA agent. Choice of antimicrobial therapy was mostly empiric, as bacterial diagnosis usually takes longer than 24 hours. Some factors distinguished influenza-MRSA-coinfected children. The majority of them were in adolescence and were previously healthy. They usually developed leukopenia on their first PICU day, frequently had neutropenia (despite a higher GCSF serum level), and most often were cannulated for ECMO support. Early recognition of this patient profile could guide choice of empiric therapy. Difficulty in reaching therapeutic levels of vancomycin in pediatric patients with good renal clearance is common [31, 32] and not consistently improved by the addition of a vancomycin loading dose [33] . The area-under-the-curve (AUC):MIC ratio has been posited as a potentially better predictor of vancomycin efficacy than vancomycin trough levels [34, 35] . However, clinical outcomes are not reported to be improved even with adequate AUC:MIC early in invasive MRSA infections [35] . Investigators who systematically reviewed available studies concluded that vancomycin poorly penetrates lung tissue. Compared to simultaneous plasma levels, concentrations in lung epithelial lining fluid ranged from 5% to 25%, and concentrations in whole homogenized lung tissues ranged from 24% to 41% [36] .",

Duration of symptoms prior to initial presentation was not available early in the study. Our analysis of the available data on time to presentation and our sensitivity analysis show that although longer time from symptom onset to PICU admission was associated with increased fatality, it was unlikely to explain the association between vancomycin monotherapy and death. We did not collect data on antimicrobial-related adverse events, which would have been difficult given the high rate of multiorgan failure on PICU admission in the MRSA-coinfected children. It is important to note that MRSA coinfection can occur with other viruses.

Because results of diagnostic tests for MRSA and influenza can be delayed by more than 24 hours, empiric therapy may be needed to optimize clinical outcomes. Older age and prior good health, as well as leukopenia and shock requiring vasopressor support on presentation, were associated with MRSA coinfection. Thus, patients who present with acute respiratory distress and similar features during influenza season should prompt consideration of an additional anti-MRSA antibiotic while further diagnostic studies are pending. Although addition of clindamycin to vancomycin appears prudent in cases with high clinical suspicion of influenza-MRSA coinfection, clindamycin resistance must be monitored. A national ongoing registry of these fatal pediatric coinfections, with antimicrobial susceptibility, antibiotic management, and collection of clinical samples, could help guide care. Addition of adjunct therapies, such as antibodies targeted at S. aureus toxins, may decrease mortality in children with MRSA coinfection.",
